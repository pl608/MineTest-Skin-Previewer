# MineTest-Skin-Previewer
a minecraft skin previewer made in unity3d gameengine
# FOR THOSE WHO CARE
I had to delete the release(at least for the present) because I realised I was using assets that where liscensed so that I could not post them on github
I will make a new release that contains only MY assets soon
